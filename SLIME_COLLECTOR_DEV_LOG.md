## 🐛 **Critical Bug Fixes**

### **Issue 1: React Strict Mode Double Counting**
- **Problem**: Attempts counted by 2s instead of 1s
- **Root Cause**: React Strict Mode intentionally double-calls state updates
- **Solution**: Implemented attempt deduplication using `useRef<Set<string>>`
- **Result**: Attempts now count correctly while maintaining Strict Mode compatibility

### **Issue 2: Wrong Problem Generation**
- **Problem**: "12 + 17" showing instead of 1-10 range problems
- **Root Cause**: Initially suspected wrong skill selection, turned out to be working correctly
- **Solution**: Added debugging, confirmed `add_1_10` generates correct 1-10 problems
- **Result**: Problem generation verified working as expected

### **Issue 3: World Progression Logic**
- **Problem**: Beach biome not unlocking after mastering `add_1_10`
- **Root Cause**: World rewards were self-referential (Meadow world → meadow biome)
- **Solution**: Shifted rewards to unlock next biome (Meadow world → beach biome)
- **Result**: Proper linear progression (master add_1_10 → unlock Beach)

### **Issue 4: `mc4()` Function Bugs**
- **Problem**: Correct answers not appearing in multiple choice options
- **Root Cause**: Slicing logic could remove correct answer
- **Solution**: Added safety check to guarantee correct answer inclusion
- **Result**: All problems now have correct answer in options

---

## 🧠 **Technical Architecture**

### **Core Systems**

#### **Skill System (`src/core/skills.ts`)**
```typescript
// 25 Problem Generators
function g_add_1_10(): Problem {
  const a = ri(1, 10), b = ri(1, 10), ans = a + b;
  return { a, b, op: '+', answer: ans, options: mc4(ans, [ans-1, ans+1, a, b], 0, 40) };
}

// Registry
export const SKILLS: Record<SkillID, SkillDef> = {
  add_1_10: { id: 'add_1_10', label: 'Addition 1–10', diff: 1.00, kind: 'add', gen: g_add_1_10 },
  // ... 24 more skills
};
```

#### **World Progression (`src/core/progression.ts`)**
```typescript
export const WORLDS: WorldDef[] = [
  { id:'meadow', title:'Meadow', primarySkill:'add_1_10', gate:GATES.EARLY, rewards:{ biomeId:'beach' } },
  // ... 15 more worlds
];

// Mastery Gates
export const GATES = {
  EARLY: { attempts: 20, minAcc: 0.90, maxAvgMs: 6000 },
  MID:   { attempts: 25, minAcc: 0.88, maxAvgMs: 7000 },
  LATE:  { attempts: 30, minAcc: 0.85, maxAvgMs: 9000 },
};
```

#### **Shop Logic (`src/core/shop-logic.ts`)**
```typescript
export const ALL_SHOP_ITEMS: ShopItem[] = [
  { id: 'skin_green', type: 'skin', skin: 'green', tier: 'common', biome: 'meadow' },
  // ... 35+ skins mapped to biomes
];

// 3x weighting for bias biome
function todaysPicks(profile, allItems) {
  // Implements biome bias with tier diversity
}
```
